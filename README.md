# Restaurant Rating Prediction Model

## Objective
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model to predict the aggregate rating of a restaurant based on other features.

## Steps

### Step 1: Preprocess the Dataset
1. **Handle Missing Values**: Impute missing values or drop them based on the significance.
2. **Encode Categorical Variables**: Convert categorical variables into numerical representations.
3. **Split the Data**: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.

### Step 2: Select a Regression Algorithm
1. **Linear Regression**: Suitable for modeling linear relationships.
2. **Decision Tree Regression**: Effective for capturing non-linear relationships.

### Step 3: Train the Model
Use the selected regression algorithm to train the model on the training data.

### Step 4: Evaluate Model Performance
1. **Regression Metrics**: Calculate metrics like MSE, RMSE, and R2 on the testing data.
2. **Compare Performance**: Assess the model's performance against baselines or other algorithms.

### Step 5: Interpret Results and Analyze Influential Features
1. **Coefficient Analysis**: Examine coefficients (in linear regression) or feature importances (in decision tree regression) to identify influential features.
2. **Visualization**: Optionally, visualize feature importance for deeper insights.

## Usage
1. **Dependencies**: Ensure you have necessary libraries like scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy installed. You can install them using pip:


pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy


2. **Run the Model**: Execute the provided Python script or Jupyter notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

```bash
python restaurant_rating_prediction.py
```
